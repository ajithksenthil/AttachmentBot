# Chatbot for Psychological Assessment ToolBox

This toolbox is designed to empower psychological researchers to utilize chatbots for administering psychological assessments and extracting valuable data from chat transcripts. It includes code, visual guides, and step-by-step instructions, making it accessible even for those with limited technical or coding experience.

## Overview

The Chatbot for Psychological Assessment Toolbox provides researchers with the resources to set up a chatbot, integrate psychological questionnaires, collect and process data from chat interactions, and apply machine learning models to analyze the data. This approach leverages the power of natural language processing and machine learning to offer deeper insights into psychological assessments.

## Contents

- **Data Collection Scripts**: Scripts to collect chat transcripts and transform them into a structured format for analysis.
- **Embedding and Feature Extraction Scripts**: Code to convert chat transcripts into numerical embeddings using AI models. Additional scripts for extracting relevant features from the data.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Pre-built models and scripts for training new models on your data. This includes regression models to predict psychological scores from chat transcript embeddings.
- **Visualization Tools**: Scripts to create visual representations of the data and analysis results, aiding in easier interpretation and presentation.
- **Step-by-Step Guides**: Detailed instructions for each component of the toolbox, ensuring ease of use and understanding.
- **Example Datasets**: Sample data to test and understand the flow of the toolbox.

## Getting Started

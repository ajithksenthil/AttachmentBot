# Chatbot for Psychological Assessment

This chatbot uses Gradio and the OpenAI API to assess people, as part of research conducted by the Attachment and Close Relationships Lab at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

To run the chatbot, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
If you don't already have an OpenAI API key, create one and set it as an environment variable called OPENAI_API_KEY.
Run python chatbot.py to start the chatbot.
Select the type of input you'd like to use (text or audio) and enter or speak your message to the chatbot.
The chatbot will dynamically survey you on your attachment and close relationships.
Note that this chatbot is not intended to provide professional advice or diagnosis, and is for research purposes only.

If you have any issues or questions, please reach out to the Attachment and Close Relationships Lab at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

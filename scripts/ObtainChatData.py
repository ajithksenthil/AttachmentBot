# ObtainChatData.py
# Purpose: Script to load and preprocess chat transcripts for psychological assessments.

# Imports
import pandas as pd

# Load & inspect dataset
input_datapath = "data/chatbotdata.csv"
output_datapath = "data/processed_chat_data.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(input_datapath)
print("Initial Data Loaded. Here's a preview:")
print(df.head(2))

# Data Preprocessing
# You can add any specific preprocessing steps here. For now, we are just dropping rows with missing values.
df = df.dropna()
print(f"Data after cleaning: {len(df)} entries")

# TODO: Add any specific cleaning or preprocessing steps here. For example, you might want to standardize the text, remove special characters, etc.

# Save the processed data
df.to_csv(output_datapath, index=False)
print(f"Processed data saved to {output_datapath}")

# Note to Users:
# - Ensure that your data file path is correctly specified in 'input_datapath'.
# - The script currently includes a basic data cleaning step (dropping missing values). Depending on your data, you may need to add more preprocessing steps.
# - The processed data is saved in CSV format. Make sure to use this processed file in subsequent analysis scripts.
